# Phyphox CSV to GPX

This app converts the recorded CSV file to a GPX one in order to visualize the track using third-party platforms such as [Sports Track Live](https://www.sportstracklive.com/en).

## Usage:

./executable input.csv output.gpx

If you omit one of the parameteres, the application will ask for the other one.

## External dependencies:

  - [ShellProgressBar](https://github.com/Mpdreamz/shellprogressbar): A great nuget library for visualizing the progress of a task.
